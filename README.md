## Shmmywiki Auto-results

#### Introduction

Auto-results is a set of tools developed for the Shmmywiki platform. The desired functionality is to:
- Extract course exam dates from the schedule PDF file provided by the ECE School website
- Fetch shmmy forum posts where course exam results are announced by users
- Use keyword matching on each post's content to find the corresponding course
- Generate wiki code for results table with exam and announcement dates, difference in days between them and URL of announcement post as columns

#### Progress

The project is still experimental with many core features missing or poorly implemented, such as:
- An all-in-one script that fetches data and exports them to Shmmywiki as a bot, so that the task can be time scheduled.
- A better keyword matching algorithm, switching from a greedy to a more clever approach (e.g. keyword trees).
- More information included in courses database, such as semester, flow etc.
- Different course groups may have same exam dates but usually have different results dates. In this case, consider them as separate courses and implement keyword matching for each group.
- More flexible project structure for easier transitions in case of change in schedule file format and layout, or addition/modification/removal of courses

#### Project structure

The project is organized as follows:
- root folder: All the scripts are stored here.
-- `utils.py`: Contains helper text functions used in keyword matching algorithm and the extraction of exam results dates from forum posts
-- `match_keywords.py`: Helper function that implements the keyword matching algorithm
-- `search_with_keyword.py`: Demo script that uses the `match_keywords` to search for courses by keyword
-- `print_keywords.py`: Prints keyword database in JSON format using pprint
-- `print_courses.py`: Prints courses database in JSON format using pprint
-- `update_course_list.py`: Migrates changes in course list file to courses database and keywords database
-- `build_keywords.py`: Tool to browse keywords database or add/edit/remove keywords from a selected course
-- `pdfparse.py`: Parses schedule PDF file and exports course exam dates to `outputs/dates.json`
-- `fetch_results.py`: Fetches result dates and URLs from forum posts and exports them to `outputs/results.json`
-- `export_wiki.py`: Combines `dates.json` and `results.json` data to generate wiki code for results table
- `db`: All the course and course keywords information is stored here.
-- `course_list.txt`: Plain-text list of course titles. The ID of each course is given by its corresponding line number in this file.
-- `courses.json`: Simple JSON to map course IDs to course titles. It is generated by `update_course_list.py`.
-- `keywords.json`: JSON that maps each possible keyword to a list of courses that are matched by it. Do not edit directly, use `build_keywords.py` for any changes instead.
- `outputs`: All the script outputs are stored here.
-- `dates.json`: JSON that maps course IDs to exam dates. It is generated by `pdfparse.py`.
-- `results.json`: JSON that maps course IDs to result dates and result URLs. It is generated by `fetch_results.py`.
-- `export_wiki.txt`: Plain-text wiki code for the results table. It is generated by `export_wiki.py`.
- `pdf-parse`: Schedule PDFs and debug files for `pdfparse.py` are stored here.
-- `dump.html`: Creates SVG files that model how `pdfparse.py` views the schedule tables to make debugging easier.
-- Schedule PDFs: The lab animals

#### Workflow

In order for the scripts to run correctly, the user should follow these steps in the right order:
1. Include target schedule PDF in the `pdf-parse` folder.
1. Change `SCHEDULE_FILE` parameter in `pdfparse.py` to the corresponding filename.
1. Run `pdfparse.py`.
1. Change `FORUM_URL` parameter in `fetch_results.py` to the corresponding URL of the forum thread where the result announcements will be posted.
1. Run `fetch_results.py`.
1. Run `export_wiki.py`.
1. Use wiki code provided in `outputs/export_wiki.txt`.
